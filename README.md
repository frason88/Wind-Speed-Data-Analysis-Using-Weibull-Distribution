## Project Overview
Our project, "Wind Speed Data Analysis Using Weibull Distribution," aims to identify optimal locations in Ireland for wind turbine installation. Utilizing the Weibull distribution, we analyze wind speed data across various seasons and locations, employing methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Method of Moments (MoM), and Least Squares (LS).

## Objectives
1. **Analyze Wind Speed Data**: Using Weibull distribution parameters to model wind speed data.
2. **Compare Seasonal Wind Patterns**: Evaluate the variation in wind speeds across different seasons.
3. **Identify Optimal Locations**: Determine the best sites for wind turbine installation based on wind speed consistency and predictability.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Historical wind speed data from multiple stations in Ireland.
- **Weibull Distribution**: Applied both two-parameter and three-parameter Weibull distributions to model wind speeds.
- **Parameter Estimation Methods**: Implemented MLE, MoM, and LS to estimate Weibull parameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Used Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test for model validation.

## Key Findings
- **Optimal Sites for Wind Turbines**: Dublin Airport and Roches Point emerged as the best locations for consistent wind energy production.
- **Seasonal Analysis**: Autumn and spring seasons at these locations showed high probabilities (around 81% and 82%) of wind speeds falling within the optimal range of 5 to 21 m/s, crucial for efficient turbine operation.
- **Method Efficacy**: MLE was found to be the most robust method for fitting Weibull distribution to the wind speed data across different locations and seasons.

## Conclusion
Our comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of Dublin Airport and Roches Point for wind energy projects due to their favorable wind speed distributions. The study's insights contribute to the strategic planning of wind energy installations, ensuring enhanced efficiency and reliability.
